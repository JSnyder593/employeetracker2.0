# Employee-Tracker

## Description
This challenge was assigned so that I could apply SQL, constructor functions, etc. to create a user friendly terminal that can be interacted with to view employees, departments, roles so that they can be assigned, updated, etc. and be viewed in the terminal.

## Installation

Copy the code in the GitHub repo at the top right, Clone this in gitbash using git clone and the link copied in step 1. Install Node Package Manager by entering “npm init -y “ into the terminal, Install inquirer using the command “npm install inquirer” into the terminal, Install console.table using the command "npm i console.log", install mySQL & mySQL2 using "npm i mysq/mysql2 (each is done separately) and then go into the terminal. In SQL, SOURCE the schema, seeds and query to initiate the database and afterwards exit mySQL. Then initiate the terminal by entering "node index.js". This will take you through the terminal.
